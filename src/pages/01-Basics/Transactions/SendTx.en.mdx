# Send Transaction

Let's send a transaction.

When submitting a transaction, you must specify the `TransactionType` field, which indicates what type of transaction, and the `Account` field, which indicates the account to which the transaction is being submitted.
Some fields, such as the `Fee` field, which indicates the transaction fee to be consumed, and the `Sequence` field, which uniquely identifies the transaction for the account, can be filled in automatically.

Try to send the simplest transaction here.

`AccountSet` transaction is a transaction to change account settings.
If a transaction is sent without specifying the account settings, the account settings will not be changed at all, only the transaction fee will be consumed.

First, use the validate button to check that the JSON data for the transaction is correct.
Then use the autofill button to set the autofill field, and finally use the submit button to submit the transaction.
